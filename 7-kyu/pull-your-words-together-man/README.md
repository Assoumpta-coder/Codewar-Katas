Here's a sample of a sentence that it outputs:</p><pre><code>["this","is","a","sentence"]</code></pre><p>Every time that it tries to say a sentence, instead of formatting it in normal English orthography, it just outputs a list of words.</p><p>Robbie has pulled multiple all-nighters to get this project finished, and he needs some beauty sleep. So, he wants you to write the last part of his code, a <code>sentencify</code> function, which takes the output that the machine gives, and formats it into proper English orthography.</p><p>Your function should:</p><ol><li>Capitalise the first letter of the first word.</li><li>Add a period (<code>.</code>) to the end of the sentence.</li><li>Join the words into a complete string, with spaces.</li><li>Do <em>no other manipulation</em> on the words.</li></ol><hr><p>Here are a few examples of what your function should do:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Input</th><th>Output</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>["i", "am", "an", "AI"]</code></td><td><code>"I am an AI."</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>["FIELDS","of","CORN","are","to","be","sown"]</code></td><td><code>"FIELDS of CORN are to be sown."</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>["i'm","afraid","I","can't","let","you","do","that"]</code></td><td><code>"I'm afraid I can't let you do that."</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong><em>(Any translations (eg: to Java/C#/C++/Typescript) would be greatly appreciated!)</em></strong></p>
